The 'ages' fold extracts all the ages containined within a 'Person'.

 * Define a function that tests whether any of the ages exceed the given
   integer:

     anyOlderThan :: Int -> Person -> Bool

   (Avoid producing an intermediate list. The 'Optics.Fold' module has many
   useful eliminators for folds.)

 * Define the same function using 'has', which tests whether a fold returns any
   values.  Hint: check out 'filtered :: (a -> Bool) -> AffineFold a a'.
-}

ages :: Fold Person Int
ages = personAge `summing` (personPets % folded % petAge)

anyOlderThan :: Int -> Person -> Bool
anyOlderThan age person = anyOf ages (> age) person

anyOlderThan' :: Int -> Person -> Bool
anyOlderThan' age person = has (ages % filtered (> age)) person


{-
 * Define a `Fold Person Pet` that visits every Pet whose age is greater than
   the given integer:

     petsOlderThan :: Int -> Fold Person Pet

 * Use it to define a function that returns the list of names of such pets.

     petNamesOlderThan :: Int -> Person -> [String]

 * Why is 'filtered' a fold rather than a traversal?  Hint: read the Haddocks
   for 'unsafeFiltered'.
-}

petsOlderThan :: Int -> Fold Person Pet
petsOlderThan age = personPets % folded % filtered ((>age) . _petAge)

petNamesOlderThan :: Int -> Person -> [String]
petNamesOlderThan = undefined



{-
 * Define a traversal that visits the name of a person and all the names of
   their pets:

     names :: Traversal' Person String

 * Use it to implement a function that capitalises all the names (using
   'Data.Char.toUpper'):

     capitaliseNames :: Person -> Person
-}

names :: Traversal' Person String
names = undefined

capitaliseNames :: Person -> Person
capitaliseNames = undefined


{-
 * Define a function that takes a list of 'Person's, each for each name that
   each of them contain (including pets' names), print out the name and read a
   replacement value from standard input:

    replaceNames :: [Person] -> IO [Person]

  For example:

    ghci> replaceNames [alice,bob]
    Replacement for Alice: Charlie
    Replacement for Bob: Bob
    Replacement for Mr Scruffy: Tiddles
    [MkPerson {_personName = "Charlie", _personAge = 65, _personPets = []},MkPerson {_personName = "Bob", _personAge = 42, _personPets = [MkPet {_petName = "Tiddles", _petAge = 3}]}]

{-
Here is a datatype of binary trees with labels at the nodes and leaves.

 * Define a traversal of the leaf labels:

     leaves :: Traversal (Tree a b) (Tree a' b) a a'

   Hint: use 'traversalVL'.

 * Test your traversal by using it to 'print' out the values stored in
   'treeExample'.  Try 'traverseOf' and 'traverseOf_'.  How and why do they
   differ?

 * Define pre-order, in-order and post-order traversals of the node
   labels:

      preorder, inorder, postorder :: Traversal (Tree a b) (Tree a b') b b'

   (A pre-order traversal visits the node label first, then the left subtree,
   then the right subtree. An in-order traversal visits the node label between
   the subtrees. A post-order traversal visits the node label after the
   subtrees.)

 * Define a function

     attachIndices :: Num e => Traversal s t a (e, a) -> s -> t

   that traverses the structure and annotates each value with its index
   (i.e. attach 0 to the first value visited by the traversal, 1 to the next,
   and so on).

   Compare the results of using 'attachIndices' with 'preorder', 'inorder' and
   'postorder' on 'treeExample'.

Here's a datatype of rose trees, where each node has a label and zero or more
children.

 * Define a (pre-order) traversal of the labels in a rose tree:

     rtreeLabels :: Traversal (RTree a) (RTree b) a b

 * Use 'attachIndices' defined above to annotate the labels of 'rtreeExample'
   with their indices.

 * Define a non-type changing traversal of the labels without using
   'traversalVL':

     rtreeLabels' :: Traversal' (RTree a) a

   Instead, use 'adjoin' to combine traversals built from the fields (you will
   also need 'traversed').  Why can't this produce a type-changing traversal?

 * Define a "lens" focused on the value stored in 'Dubious', that uses the 'Int'
  field to count the number of times the structure has been accessed.

 * Define a type-preserving "traversal" that visits the value stored in
   'Duplicated' twice.  Can you define such a type-modifying traversal?

 * How does this violate the 'Lens' and 'Traversal' laws? Does it matter?

 * The following table is scrambled. Unscramble it, then compare the type
   signatures of the class methods and the corresponding eliminators.  What do
   you notice?
